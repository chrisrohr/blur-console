########## BlurTools User's Guide (Draft) ########## 

@@@@@@@@ Navigation Bar Guide: @@@@@@@@

The navigation bar has three major functionalities:

  1) It is a means to traverse the application
  2) It gives the user the ability to change the "zookeeper" context of the application:
    - The context can be switched by using the "Current Zookeeper Instance" selector located at the center of the navigation bar.
    - This selector is a list of all zookeepers that your application is currently tracking.
    - This selector is present on every page that displays zookeeper relevant information.
    - Selecting a new zookeeper will refresh the content of the current page using the new zookeeper.
  3) It has a link to your "User" page:
    - This is located in the top right, next to the "logout" button.

@@@@@@@@ Dashboard Page: @@@@@@@@

  The "Dashboard" page is a high level view of the overall health of your system. Each box on this page represents a different zookeeper and displays information for that zookeeper.

  - The header of each zookeeper box displays whether or not the system is online. 
  - The first row gives the user a warning about inconsistent blur versions.
  -- If the system detects that any of the controllers or shards are using inconsistent versions of Blur, then the status changes to "Inconsistent Blur Versions".
  - The next three rows of the box are an aggregation of all the different states of all the controllers and shards respectively. 
  -- The "online", "disabled", and "offline" bars display the number of shards/controllers that are currently online, disabled, and offline.
  - Clicking on a Zookeeper box will take the user to the Environment page of that particular blur instance.
  - A warning will appear at the bottom of the box if there are any "long running" queries.
  -- This warning is a count of the number queries that have been running for more than a minute.
  
@@@@@@@@ Environment Status Page: @@@@@@@@

  The "Environment" page is a zookeeper specific status page.

  - The top section lists some of the details about the current zookeeper such as the name, the connection (URL), and its current status. 
  - The "controllers" box lists each controller with its name, blur version, and status.
  - The "shards" box lists each shard with its name, blur version, and status.
  
@@@@@@@@ BlurTables Page: @@@@@@@@

  The "Blur Tables" page is a list of all the BlurTables associated with the current zookeeper. Each row contains information describing a BlurTable.
  
  - The "Hosts/Shards" column is a link that displays a dialog with a list of all the hosts and shards for that BlurTable when clicked.
  - "Record Count" is the number of records in that particular table.
  - "Size" is the total size of the table on disk.
  - "Queries/Second" is a calculated metric for the overall throughput of that table.
  - "Status" indicates whether the table is enabled or disabled.
  - "Schema" is a link that displays a list of Column families and their columns when clicked.
  -- Each entry also shows the name of its analyzer.
  
  In addition to this information, the table row is clickable. Clicking a row will display an additional row containing the location of the table on disk and the "enable/disable/delete" table buttons; each button performs the action implied by their name. The "delete" table button displays a confirmation dialog asking whether the user would like to also delete the underlying index of the selected table, or to just delete the table. The bottom of the table has a count of the total number of tables in this zookeeper instance.
  
@@@@@@@@ BlurQueries Page: @@@@@@@@

  The "Blur Queries" page is a list of recently executed Blur Queries.
  
  - The "Filters" section is a set of options for limiting what queries are displayed in the list.
  -- The "Within past" selector allows you to limit the queries based on how long ago the query was submitted.
  -- The "Super Query" option allows to show or hide queries based on whether they were run with super query on or off.
  -- The "Running" option allows users to filter the queries by their running state.
  -- The "Interrupted" option allows users to filter the queries by whether or not they have been interrupted.
  - The "Blur Table" selector filters the queries list what table the query was ran against.
  - The "Refresh" selector allows the user to choose how often the table information is refreshed.
  -- When the table is refreshed, queries are automatically added, updated, and deleted.
  --- When a query is added, it flashes green.
  --- When a query is updated, it flashes orange.
  --- When a query is deleted, it flashes red before it is removed from the table.
  
  Underneath the filters section is the queries table.
  
  - To the top right of the table is a list of current filters.
  - The "User Id" column shows the ID of the user that submitted that query.
  - The "Query" column is the text of the executed query. This is only visible to users with the auditor role.
  -- Only the first 20 characters of the query text are displayed on the table. The full text can be seen by hovering your mouse over the query column.
  - The "Super Query" column shows whether super query was used to execute the query.
  - The "Start" column shows the starting offset for the executed query.
  - The "Fetch" column shows the amount of records fetched for the executed query.
  - The "CPU time / Real time (ms)" column is a calculated metric for the total life span of the executed query.
  - The "Status" column shows the percent of shards that have completed the query.
  - The "Actions" column gives users the ability to cancel queries that are still in the running state. This is only visible for users with the editor role.
  - The "More Info" link displays details associated with the executed query. This is only visible to users with the auditor role.
