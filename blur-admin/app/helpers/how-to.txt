@@@@@@@@ Navigation Bar Guide: @@@@@@@@

The navigation bar has three major functionalities:

  1) It is a means to traverse the application //A means to traverse the application:
  2) It gives the user the ability to change the "zookeeper" context of the application:
    - The context can be switched by using the "Current Zookeeper Instance" selector located at the center of the navigation bar.
    - This selector is a list of all zookeepers that your application is currently tracking.
    - This selector is present on every page excluding the "dashboard" page (the dashboard does not have a context).
    - Selecting a new zookeeper will refresh the content of the current page using the new zookeeper. //By selecting a new zookeeper the current page will refresh the content of the page using the new zookeeper.
  3) It has a link to your "User" page: //A link to your "User" page:
    - This is located in the top right, next to the "logout" button.

@@@@@@@@ Dashboard Page: @@@@@@@@

  The "Dashboard" page is a high level view of the overall health of your system. Each box on this page represents a different zookeeper and displays information for that zookeeper. //within each these boxes is***(are, not is) a set of warnings and statuses for the different pieces of the Blur instance.

  - The header of each zookeeper box displays whether or not the system is online. 
  - The first row gives the user a warning about inconsistent blur versions.
  -- If the system detects that any of the controllers or shards are using inconsistent versions of Blur,** then the status changes to "Inconsistent Blur Versions" and the background changes to red.
  - The next three rows of the box are an aggregation of all the different states of all the controllers and shards respectively. 
  -- The "online", "disabled", and "offline" bars display the number of shards/controllers that are currently online, disabled, and offline.
  - Clicking on a Zookeeper box will take the user to the Environment page of that particular blur instance. //Each Zookeeper box is clickable, when clicked it will take the user to the Environment page for that particular blur instance.
  - A warning will appear at the bottom of the box if there are any "long running" queries. //The bottom of the box is reserved for the "long running" queries warning.
  -- This warning is a count of the number queries that have been running for more than a minute. //in the running state for more than a minute.
  
@@@@@@@@ Environment Status Page: @@@@@@@@

  The "Environment" page is a zookeeper specific status page.

  - The top section lists some of the details about the current zookeeper
  -- Detail such as the name, the connection (URL), and its current status. 
  - The "controllers" box lists each controller with its name, blur version, and status. //out each controller giving its name, blur version, and status.
  - The "shards" box lists each shard with its name, blur version, and status. //out each shard giving its name, blur version, and status of each shard.
  
@@@@@@@@ BlurTables Page: @@@@@@@@

  The "Blur Tables" page is a list of all the BlurTables associated with the current zookeeper. Each row contains information describing a BlurTable.//in the table represents a different table and  its associated information.
  
  - The "Hosts/Shards" column is a link that displays //a dialog with// a list of all the hosts and shards for that BlurTable when clicked// each table.
  - "Record Count" is the number of records in that particular table.
  - "Size" is the total size of the table on disk.
  - "Queries/Second" is a calculated metric for the overall throughput of that table.
  - "Status" indicates whether the table is enabled or disabled.
  - "Schema" is a link that displays //a dialog with// a list of Column families and their columns **when clicked. --> capitalize/dont col fam & col
  -- Each entry //in this display// also shows the name of its analyzer.
  
  In addition to this information,** the table row is clickable. Clicking a row will display an additional row containing the location of the table on disk and the "enable/disable/delete" table buttons; each button performs the action implied by their name. The "delete" table button displays a confirmation dialog asking whether the user would like to also delete the underlying index of the selected table, or to just delete the table. The bottom of the table has a count of the total number of tables in this zookeeper instance.

  -- The "Running" option allows users to filter the queries by their running state.
  -- The "Interrupted" option allows users to filter the queries by whether or not they have been interrupted.
  - The "Blur Table" selector filters the queries list //by// what table the query was //run// ran against.
  - The "Refresh" selector allows the user to choose how often the table information is refreshed. //is refreshed and repopulated.
